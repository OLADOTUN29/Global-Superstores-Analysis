### Introdution

This a Micorsoft Excel project analysis which provides insights into the findings within the **Global Superstore dataset**. This dataset reflects various occurrences related to an online retailer based in New York, which, in the year 2014, offered a diverse array of 10,000 products to customers in 147 different countries.The analysis covers a range of performance metrics, including identifying countries with the highest total profits, calculating average total profits, and assessing countries that underperformed among the 147 countries among other factors.

### Problem Statement

Question 1.

a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?

b) For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically,
what are the product names and the total profit for each product?

Question 3.

Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar
(Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
