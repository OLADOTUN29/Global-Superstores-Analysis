### Introdution

This a Micorsoft Excel project analysis which provides insights into the findings within the **Global Superstore dataset**. This dataset reflects various occurrences related to an online retailer based in New York, which, in the year 2014, offered a diverse array of 10,000 products to customers in 147 different countries.The analysis covers a range of performance metrics, including identifying countries with the highest total profits, calculating average total profits, and assessing countries that underperformed among the 147 countries among other factors.

### Problem Statement

Question 1.

a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?

b) For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically,
what are the product names and the total profit for each product?

Question 2.

Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.

Question 3.

a) Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African
countries?

b) What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate
shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.

Question 4.

a) Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia.
Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar
(Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

b) Is there a specific country i n Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the
subcategory identified in 4a?

Question 5.

a) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis,
discard the cities with less than 10 Orders.

b) Why is this city’s average profit so low?

Question 6.

Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?

Question 7.

Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?

## Conclusion 

Upon scrutinizing the dataset, it became evident that three countries generated the highest total profits. The United States secured the top spot with approximately $93,508, followed by India with around $48,808, and China with $46,794. Additionally, certain products exhibited outstanding sales performance in these countries:

United States
Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier
GBC DocuBind TL300 Electric Binding System
Hewlett Packard LaserJet 3310 Copier
India
Cisco Smart Phone, with Caller ID
Hamilton Beach Refrigerator, Red
Sauder Classic Bookcase, Traditional
China
Bush Classic Bookcase, Mobile
HP Copy Machine, Color
Sauder Classic Bookcase, Metal

In contrast, Nigeria experienced notably low total profits, amounting to -$23,285.19, indicating a loss rather than profit accumulation in 2014. This outcome was attributed to the operational dynamics of the business. The analysis revealed that the primary reasons behind the loss in 2014 were the combination of low shipping costs and a high discount percentage. While other countries refrained from offering discounts and maintained higher shipping rates, Nigeria provided a discount of $193 alongside a low shipping rate.

The analysis of the global superstores' dataset indicates that in the United States, copiers, machines, and tables emerged as the top three subcategories with the highest average shipping fees, amounting to $165.29, $132.25, and $69.95, respectively.
In Southeast Asia, encompassing countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, it was observed that the "Table" subcategory had the lowest profits. Specifically, the report highlights that Global Superstore experienced a significant loss of -$10,680.28 from its operations in Indonesia compared to other countries. Consequently, it is recommended to discontinue offering this subcategory to prevent further declines in profit.
Concord, identified as the least profitable city in the United States, recorded only one order exceeding 10 orders and suffered a loss of -$1,862.31. This could be attributed to production costs or the procurement of products, resulting in reduced profit margins.

Further insights gleaned from the dataset reveal that **Appliances** are the product subcategory with the highest average profit in Australia.

Additionally, the dataset provides insights into the presence of highly valuable customers who have significantly contributed to the overall profit of Global Superstore and the type of product they purchased.
